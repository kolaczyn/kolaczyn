# Hi, I'm Pawe≈Ç

I've been studying web development since the July of 2020. I learned a lot in the last year.  
Currently, I'm looking for my first job in the industry.

## My Frontend Skills

It's where I spend most of my time and feel the most comfortable writing code.

- Semantic HTML
- Modern CSS, SCSS, Tailwind, Chakra UI
- Responsive Design
- JavaScript, TypeScript, ES6+
- Git
- React, Next.js, Redux, Styled Components, Formik
- Vue, Vuex, Nuxt.js
- Figma, basic web design skills
- Jest, Testing Library
- Consuming REST API

## My Backend Skills

I don't feel as strong with these, but at least I know that there isn't some magic going on in the backend.

- Terminal and Linux usage
- MySQL, SQLite and MongoDB
- Python, Flask
- Node.js, Express
- Creating REST API
