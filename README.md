# Hi, I'm Pawe≈Ç

I've been studying web development since the July of 2020. I learned a lot in the last year.  
Currently, I'm looking for my first job in the industry.

## Frontend Skills

It's where I spend most of my time and feel the most comfortable writing code.

- HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Design
- SCSS, Tailwind, Chakra UI, Styled Components
- JavaScript, TypeScript, ES6
- Git, Git Flow
- React, Next
- JAM with Gatsby
- Vue, Nuxt
- Consuming z REST oraz GraphQL API
- Web design in Figma

## Backend Skills

I don't feel as strong with these, but at least I know that there isn't some magic going on in the backend.

- Terminal, Linux
- MySQL, MongoDB
- Node.js, Express
- Docker
